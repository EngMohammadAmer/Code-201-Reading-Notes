# LISTS

There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
1. <ol> The ordered list is created with the <ol> element.
2. <li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)

* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
1. <ul> The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
2. <li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)

* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
1. <dl> The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
- Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements.
2. <dt> This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
3. <dd> This is used to contain the definition.

* Nested Lists
You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.


# BOXES

[check this PDF](boxes.pdf)

## Summary
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

# Basic JavaScript Instructions

## Summary
* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

# Decisions and Loops

[check this PDF](loops.pdf)

## summary
* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
