[Check this PDF](text.pdf)

## Summary

* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

# Introducing CSS

[Check this PDF](introducingCSS.pdf)

## Summary

* CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Basic JavaScript Instructions

[Check this PDF](js1.pdf)

## Summary

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

# Decisions and Loops

[Check this PDF](js2.pdf)

## Summary

* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are two types of loop: for and while. Each repeats a set of statements.
