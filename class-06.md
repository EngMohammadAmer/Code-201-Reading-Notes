# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

[Check this PDF](objects.pdf)

## Summary

* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

# Document Object Model

[Check This PDF](documentobject.md)

## Summary

* The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
* DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
* You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
* Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadelist.
* From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
* In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
* Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
