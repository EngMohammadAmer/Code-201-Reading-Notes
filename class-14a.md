https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html

* Study groups have become a rite of passage at M.B.A. programs, a way for students to practice working in teams and a reflection of the increasing demand for employees who can adroitly navigate group dynamics.
* To prepare students for a complex work-force, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.
  * "We're living through a golden age of understanding personal productivitiy," says Marshall Van Alstyne, professor at Boston Universtiy who studies how people share information.
* Studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.
  * Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.
* Project Aristotle - code name for Google study to figure out why some teams stumbled while others soared.
  * After more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google's teams.

* 2 behaviors that "good" teams generally shared:
  * equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking (members spoke in roughly the same proportion)
  * High "average social sensitivity" - skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, expressions, and other nonverbal cues.

* **PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY - more than anything else - is critical to making a team work**

### From article on CSS Transitions & Animations

<http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/>

* CSS3 introduces ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations.
  * With CSS3 transitions you can alter appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs - such as when it's hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
  * Animations allow appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in mutliple keyframes.
    * Transitions provide a change from one state to another, animations can set mutiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
* Easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the ````:hover````, ````:focus````, ````:active````, and ````:target```` pseudo-classes
* Four transition-related properties: (first 3 are most popular)
  * ````transition-property````
  * ````transition-duration````
  * ````transition-timing-function````
  * ````transition-delay````
* **IMPORTANT NOTE**: not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point.
